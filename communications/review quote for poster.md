"Substantively, it makes little sense to reproduce the overall analysis of a meta-analysis of effects that are wrongly selected and/or computed in the first place. Perhaps for meta-researchers it is interesting to study the computational reproducibility of the analyses as a case study, but for subsantive researchers it is little more than a post-mortem inquiry."
